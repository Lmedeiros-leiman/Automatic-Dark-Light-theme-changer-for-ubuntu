# about this project

this is a simple linux bash script to automatically swap between light and dark mode based on the current time in the system.

it utilizes crontab to run the script at a specific time or just when the computer is rebooted.

by default it utilizes ubuntu Yaru red theme and can even change icons if that is you turn it on by deleting the # on the script.

Thank you for the original poster and all contributors on AskUbuntu for this code.
